Unit Conversion Practice Project 


##Overview

This is a simple unit conversion tool that converts between Metric and Imperial units. The project was created as a practice exercise to improve my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to input a value and see the equivalent conversion for length (meters/feet), volume (liters/gallons), and mass (kilograms/pounds).

##What I Practiced

HTML: Building the structure of the web page.

CSS: Styling the user interface to make it responsive and visually appealing across different devices.

JavaScript: Handling user input, performing unit conversions, and dynamically updating the page content based on user interactions.

Responsive Design: Ensuring that the layout adapts well to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Basic Input Validation: Checking for empty inputs or non-numeric values and handling them appropriately.


##Features

Converts:

Meters to Feet and vice versa.

Liters to Gallons and vice versa.

Kilograms to Pounds and vice versa.

Responsive layout that adjusts to various screen sizes.

Includes a refresh button to clear input and output fields.



##How to Use

Enter a number in the input field.

Click the "Convert" button to see the results.

If the input is empty or not a number, the fields will reset automatically.

Click the "Refresh" button to clear all fields.



##Future Improvements

Adding more unit categories (e.g., temperature, speed).

Providing error messages or visual cues for invalid input.
Enhancing the UI with more animations or styling.
